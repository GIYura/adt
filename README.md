#### Abstract Data Type

Abstract data types classify the types of data structures along with the predefined operations within the language. 
As their name implies, it doesn't specify how data types are implemented because their implementation is hidden.

Each data type in ADT is ready to use and has basic operations like insertion, deletion, or updating. 
So programmers need to know which operation an ADT can perform rather than worrying about its inner details.

**NOTE:** This repo includes implementation of the most popular ADT in C.

Data Structure Classification:

1. Linear
    - static
        - array
        - circular buffer

    - dynamic
        - licked list
        - queue
        - stack

2. Non-linear
    - tree
    - graph
